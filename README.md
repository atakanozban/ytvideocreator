# YouTube Automatic Video Creator & Uploader

Create and upload your video automatically to YouTube. This tool retrieves the audio and image files from the scripts directory and then uploads them directly to YouTube using the user's client secret. It does not store the video file on the user's computer.

### How It Works

1. Create a new folder and import your audio and image files into the folder which is you created new.
2. Download your client secret file from Google Developers (YouTube API v3)
3. Download required modules.
4. Run the script and login to your Google account.
